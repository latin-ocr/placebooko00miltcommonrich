INTRODUCTION. XV

The entry in p. 185 would seem to have been the last thing placed
on that page: it is important, as containing the dictum that against
an evil prince the sword is the only rcmedy. Whether by Milton's
hand or not, the entry was made in his lifetime. The head word ’
Divitice at p. 148, which page contains nothing but a note from
Macchiavelli, seems to be by the copier os that part of the treatise
De Doctrina Christiana of which a specimen is given in plato xx.

Sotheby's volume: the first number indicates the plate3 the second
number indicates the specimen in that plate.a A table of the
authors cited is added, and will be found at pp. 64-66 os the
present volume.

Continent. The letter is without date, but the wording ofit proves
it to have been written before [643. The writer says that he sends
to Milton a letter from the Lord lVarden of the Cinque Ports‚
and that if Milton intended to write himself he could not have a
safer convoy for both than from Suffolk House. Now, in 1638
Theophilus Howard Earl of Suffolk was Lord lVarden of the
Cinque Ports3 and his town house at Charing Cross was known as
Suffolk House. In 1642 that house was purchased by Algernon
Percy Earl of Northumberland, and the same house was afterwards
