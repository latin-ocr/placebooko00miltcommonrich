Ipsa qnoque Tellus in adventum Solis cultiori se induit vestitu, nubesque
juxta variis chlamydatae coloribus, pompa solemni, longoque ordine
videntur ancillari surgenti Deo.

In L'Alleyro.
To hear the lark begin his flight

While the coek with lively din

Seatters the rear of darkness thin,
And to the stack or the barn-door
Stoutly struts his dames before.

Right against the eastern gate

Where the great sun begins his state
Rohed in flames and amber light

The clouds in thousand liveries dig-hm

I should have liked to have added to this volume a fae-simile of
the whole or portion of the leaf containing the Latin prolusion
and verses, so that those well acquainted with Milton's writing
might judge if they were by the poet's hand.b The writing is not
as a whole like any that has been heretofore known as Milton's.
It is a stiff legal hand, with a shade of timidity. The capital
letters (except J) are wholly different from those known to be by
Milton, and the small letters e (except where the Greek e occurs)
Ιι and r are such as he never used so far as hitherto known. But
it must be recollected that Milton's father was a Scrivencr, and the
poet most likely in early years used to write in the fashion which
he saw cxcreised at home. The writings now in question may
have been executed when he was at St. Paul’s School, or in his early
college days; and the necessity of sending up a neatly written copy

¹¹ Sec also Paradisc Lost, book iv. lines 0223, 041-645; book v. lines l-ss, 20-25.
²* As this could net be donc, 1 have had a few copies taken. smil have ‹lepositcd
one (and also one of the letter by ancs) at the British Muscam.
