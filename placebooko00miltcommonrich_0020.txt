called Northumberland House, As we have no intimation from
any source of an intention by Milton to make a second journey
abroad, it may be safely concluded that the letter was written on
the occasion of Milton’s preparation for his continental excursion

in 1638.ἢ
The following is a full copy of the letter:

Sir, I have sent you with this a letter from my Lord Warden of the
Cinque Ports under his hand and seale, which wilbe a sufficient warrant
to justify your goinge out of the King’s Dominions; if you intend to
wryte yourselfe you cannot have a safer convoy for both than from

HENRY LAWEs.

that on tho soth of October, 1638, Milton and his servant, and N. Cary, brother of
Lord Falkland, Dr. Ilolding of Lancastcr, and N. Fortcscue dined at the college.

The entry, which was sent to Sir T. Duffus llardy by Mr. Stevcnson (now at Rome
exanlining· the Vatican MSS. sor our Government), is as follows, “ Octobris dic 30,
l'rnnsi sunt in Collegio nostro Illustrissimus D. N. Cary frater baronis ‹le Fnukeland,
hoctor nomina-us, Lancnstrensis, 1). N. Forteseuw. et Dominus Miltonus. cnm
famulo, nobiles Angli, et excepti sunt lariti=.''
