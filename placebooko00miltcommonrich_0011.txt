INTRODUOTION.

 

JOHN MILTON is admitted to stand second only to Shakespearc
in the roll of English Poets. Looking at the numerous testimonies
(during his lifetime) to Shakespeare’s existence, the number of his
plays and poems, the many acquaintances whom his mere profession
must necessarily have forced upon him, the friends whom his un-
doubted genial nature must have secured, and the various business
transactions in which he must have engaged before being able to
accumulate the competence on which he retired to the country,
it seems strange that six or seven signatures are all that remain of
the actual writing of him who, in literature, is England’s chief
glory. But looking at these signatures, and considering the tradi-
tions about Shakespeare's youth, it may be doubted if he was ever
a good penman: transcripts by other persons of his rough drafts
would serve for the Play House and the PreSS, and his business
transactions were most likely effected by scriveners; the circum-
stances under which he is traditionally reported to have first come
to London would perhaps prevent him from corresponding with
his country friends; and not even a copy or print of any letter by
him exists. Milton, on the other hand, had a liberal education3
early in life he made acquaintance with men of good position in
England and on the Continent3 he was in the service of the State3
many of his official and private letters are in print3 he was not
