INTRonuc'moN. ix

to an Index Theologyicus, forming a separate volume, or at least a
Section of another volume.a The Commonplace Book now printed
shows, mostly in Milton's own handwriting, a list of upwards of
eighty authors read by him—English, French, Italian, Latin, and
Greek. The entries are not mere extraets from these Authors, they
are mostly Instances and Conclusions deduced from, or fortified
by references to, them. The language is in many cases Milton's,
sometimes in English, French, Italian, or Latin.

In one or two cases where the handwriting was by an Amanuensis
the entry seems to have been made while Milton dietated the sentence:
the scribe has had just time to write or begin words, when (the sen-
tence being incomplete) Milton directed them to be cancelled, and
then substituted another phrase. An instance of this treatment is
at p. 77. In a letter by Milton to Peter Heimbach written in 1666,
he apologises for the bad writing, saying that the boy employed to
write was quite ignorant of Latin, and that he (Milton) was obliged
to dietate, not the words, but one by one the letters of which they
were composed. Such a scribe seems to have made the entry at
p. 198, where a second attempt at a proper spelling was as vain as
the first.

The leaves of the MS. measure 112} inches in height by nearly
9 inches in breadth. Originally there must have been 126 leaves,
the pagination going from 1 to 250. The leaf of table (the l26th)
is not paged. The lower halves of the first seven leaves have
been cut off; the leaves forming pp. 33-37, 83-98, 207 and 208,
225-228, and 231-234 have been cut out. Slight fragments of
the inner portions of 83-98 remain, and these have been preserved
in the rebinding of the volume, because the fragment of p. 87
shows remains of writing (not by Milton’s hand) placed trans-
versely and cut through. As the table at the end is perfect, and

³ At p. 221 is a reference to another or tlte other Index. But, as Papa. is the
subject, it seems that the Indae Tlceoloyiens was intended.
