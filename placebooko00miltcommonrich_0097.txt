Surge, age surge, leves, jam convenit, excute somnos,
Lux oritur, tepidi fulera relinque tori.

Ignavus satrapam dedecet inclyt[um]
Somnus qui populo multi-fido praeost.
Dum Dauni veteris filius armiger
Stratus purpureo p ..... buit ......
Audax Eurialus Nisus et impiger
Invasere cati noete sub horrida
Torpentes Rutilos castraque Volscia3
Hinc eaedes oritur elamor et absonus.

In the first and nineteenth lines the word emente has been substituted for arcere,
which word seems originally in each case to have ended the line. In the fistoenth
line the word somnum has been altered to somnos. In the twenty-fourth line portions

of the paper (which is very much deeayed) are torn away, and the verse is necessarily
now imperfect.
