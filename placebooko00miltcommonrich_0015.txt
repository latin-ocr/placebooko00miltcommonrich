reader to those passages in which entries in the Commonplace
Book have been clearly utilised.a These are but few3 longer
research will probably produce more. The other Commonplace
Book, which, as before noticed‚ Milton seems to have compssed,
would doubtless (if present) have caused more references. It is
noticeable that no use seems to have been made of many entries on
subjects to which Milton specially addressed himself, and where
citations of, or references to, authors of repute would have added
force, or at least authority, to his own arguments. Such an absence
of citationb is not however to be wondered at when the temper
of Milton’s mind is considered3 for it was characterised by aversion
from authority. We know, from what he has written of himself,
the ardour and extent of his studies, his consciousness of ability,
and his determination to leave somewhat which the world would
not willingly let die; so the written thoughts of other authors were
used by him as mental food to be digested and assimilated, and at
fit times to be reproduced from his brain in better or varied forms.
Milton seems to have had an exalted idea of himself and his doings.
At the age of forty he thought it not unbecoming, in a contro-
versial treatise (The Second Defence of the People of England), to
dilate with complacency on the graces of his person; and a few
years before, in the Apology for Smectymnuus, he filled several
pages with an account (and very interesting it is) of his great
diligence in study and the pursuit of virtue ; so it is not surprising
that at the more youthful age of thirty he gave a grandiloquent
account to a friend of the extent of his recent studies. In a letter
to Carlo Deodati dated 23rd of September, 1637, he sayS‚ “I was

long employed in unravelling the obscure history of the Italians
