viii INTRODUCTION.

Cambridge MS. (parts of which are by other hands) and three or
four letters and signatures‚ and perhaps a few notes in printed
books, are all that has hitherto been known to exist of the writing
of a man so celebrated.a

That Milton was a diligent reader of books we learn from the
testimony of his nephew E. Philips3 but, if that testimony had been
absent, Milton's printed works would have supplied the evidence. His
History of England may have occupied some time, and the sources of
it lay in comparatively few volumes, which may have been consulted
by him seriatim as‘he made progress with the work. But some of
his other treatises have reference to Authors of widely different
characters and concerning widely different subjects‚ and the readiness
with which his pen could engage in controversy would seem to show
that he must have accumulated stores on which he could draw for
illustrations, authorities, and proofs. A long list of Authors read or
consulted by Milton may be made from his printed works, although
he was not profuse in direct citations‚ and in many instances it is
easier to see that he drew from his store of aequired knowledge
than to ascertain the exact sources of it3 while the wealth of
allusion in the great poenis composed after he became blind seems
impossible except on the supposition of adventitious aid previously
prepared.

What might be well conjectured is now proved by the volume
soum] among Sir F. Graham's papers during recent researehes made
for the Historical Manuscripts Commission; and that volume supplies
proof that it was not the only one of the kind compiled by Milton.
It contains references to Titles which are not in that volume, and
never were in it. Moreovcr there is a marginal reference in p.. 197
