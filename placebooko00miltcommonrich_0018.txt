xiv in'rizonuc‘rION.

The hanslwritings of which the three plates in this volume do
not contain speeimens are free and flowing, and the letters of each
word are, generally, connected. Some of the entries from Italian
works are by those hands, e. 9. those from Berni at p. 71, and from
Boiardo at pp. 77 and 187: and of a smaller kind those from
Macehiavelli's Diseorsi at pp. 148, 185, 198, 242, 243, 245, and
246, which latter, though in some respects they resemble some of
Milton’s writing, I think cannot be said certainly to be by him.
The doubly looped f, the full loop to l, b, and h, are forms not-
affected by Milton3 and the capital M in two of these latter entries

is so formed that the last limb represents a capital C not looped.

the long sarcastic epitaph 011 Cardinal Mazarin which may be found at length in
charles Gildon’s Miscellany Poems, 8v0.L011d2 1692, and in vol. i. part 2 of the
State Poems, in both of which collections it is attributed to Milton. These three
lines he expands into ten lines of English verse. Then he copies the Latin epigram
on Pope Bonifaee the VIIIth (also to be found in Gildon’s Miscellany Poems, and
the. State Poenis) and gives a poetica] version of it. The same volume of MS. poetry
contains “To a friend upon reading Mr Charles Gildon’s Miscellany Poenis ''
(eighteen lines).
Beqihs. I have, Sir, by a transient look

Travers’d this miscellaneous book:

Pardon the ink which I have spilt on

The two quaint epitaphs by Milton. (Pp. 29, 333.)

The reference to pp. 29 and 33 are evidently to the peges of Gildon's volume:
the epitaph on Mazarin being at p. 29, and. the epigram on Boniface at p. 33. So
that Gildon‚ who was a coternpormy of Milton, attributed these two Latin produc-
tions to him.

Charles Gildon was a friend of Charles Blount, whose Miscellaneous lVorks were
published collectivelyin 1695, in one volume, in which is a long preface by Gildon
to the Oraeles of Reason. One of Blount's productions is “A just vindication os
Learning and the liberty of the Press,'' a tract of not quite twenty-three pages3 at
p. 4 of which he says, “I cannot but herein agree with Mr. Milton and say thar.
(unless it be effected with great cantion) you lind almost as good as kill a man as
kill a book.'' At p. 5 he says, “ 1 shall here demonstrate the unreasonableness of any
such license or Im strima†m·.'’ l’assages equal to seven pages of this short tract are,
with some tritling alterations, afterwards conve-yesi from Milton’s Areopaqitiw,
without the slightest ncknowledgment of the source. They are worked up into
Blount's tract so as to lead a render to suppose that they are original.
