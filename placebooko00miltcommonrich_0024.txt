letters in F reneha to him asking for employment under him, and
mentioning his own early schooldays and his proficiency in the
F rench language. For one of these letters he used a seal impressions
of which are found on several letters to Lord Preston by a spy
employed by him at Paris3 so that it is probable that Skinner's
services were made use of :b and the volume now printed may have
been an offering to obtain or retain the favour of his old schoolfellow.
The question how it came to its present resting-place is of secondary
interest. The authenticity of the volume is unquestionable. ι

Sir Frederick Graham, thinking it unwise to leave such a record
of some of the studies of a great man to the charge of a single
manuscript, very kindly approved my suggestion to have the
contents printed, and most liberally entrusted the volume to my
hands for that purpose. The publication of it in the ordinary
way would not (I wasinformed by a publisher) have been re-
munerative: hence the means now adopted for its perpetuation.
The thanks of many besides the Members will be given to the
President ¹and Council of the Camdcn Society for printing such an
interesting document, and to Sir F. Graham for making it known

and allowing its publication.
