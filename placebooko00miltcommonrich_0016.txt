they received their liberty from Rodolphus King of Germany.'’
Anyone would suppose that Milton had been wading through all
or most of the writers who treated of that history during the seven
centuries indicated. The Commonplace Book however shows that
we need not conclude more than that he had been reading, in a
single volume, the History of Italy by Sigoniusa from A.D. 570
to A.D. 1286, the exact space of time referred to by Milton.

The handwriting of Milton has been the subject of a monograph
by the late Mr. Leigh Sotheby, whose volume contains a full
account of the Milton MSS. at Cambridge, and of the few others
then known. Sir F. Graham’s volume contains a great mass of
writing by the Poet’s hand, though, it must be confessed, it is not
of the like interest with the Cambridge volume, because it does not
oontain any purely original compositions. The entries in the
Commonplace Book are by five or six hands. The greater
number are by Milton at various periods of his life, mostly before
his going into Italy. Two (in p. 197) are by Daniel Skinner.
Some entries are by one of the hands that copied parts of the
Treatise De Doctrina Christiana, now in the Public Record Office,
and edited by Mr. (afterwards Bishop) Sumner in 1825. Some
are by the hand which copied the Sonnet No. 17 in the Cambridge
MS.; one (at least) is by the hand that made the transcript of the '
First Book of Paradise Lost in the possession of Mr. Baker of
Bayfordbury; and some are, I feel satisfied, by Sir R. Graham of
Netherby, Viscount Preston. The autotypes which accompany the
present volume give specimens of all but two of the different
handwritings contained in Sir F. Graham's MS. Milton’s writing
generally speaks sor itself. Mr. Sotheby's volume, and the fac-
