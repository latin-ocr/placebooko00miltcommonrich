OF JOHN M112'r0N (523

Surge, age surge, leves, jam convenit, excute somnos,
Lux oritur, tepidi fulera relinque tori.

Ignavus satrapam dedocet inclyt[um]
Somnus qui populo multi-fido praeest.
Dum Dauni veteris filius impiger
Stratus purpureo p ..... buit ..... ,
Audax Erialus Nisus et impiger
Invasere cati nocte sub horrida
Torpentes Rutilos castraque Volscia3
Hinc caedes oritur clamor et absonus.

In the first and nineteenth lines the word emente has been substituted for arcere,
which word seems originally in each case to have ended the line, In the fifteenth
line the word somnum has been altered to somnos. In the twenty-fourth line portions
of the paper (which is very much decayed) are torn away, and the verse is necessarily
now imperfect.
