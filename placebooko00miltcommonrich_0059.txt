OF JOHN Ml L'roN. 31

Tyrannus, vide 248.

Sigerbertus lVest Saxonum tyrannus leges patrias conculcans
meritas luit poenas. Malmesbur. l. 1. Sto.

Richard the 2d in his 21 yeare holding a violent parlament
shorten'd his days: see in Sto. the violency of that parl. See
other tyrannicall acts an. 223 and of this parl. Holinslz. 490.

His definition. See de Reye out of Sir Tho. Smitlz, 7 et 8 c. And
Basil. distinguishes a tyrant from a K. briefly thus, τοῦτο Γγὰρ
διαφέρει τύραννος βασιλέως, ὅτι ὁ μεν τὸ ἑαυτοῦ πανταχόθεν σκοπεῖ,
ὁ δε τὸ τοῖς ἀρχομένοις ὠφέλιμον ἐκπορίζει. Tom. i. 456.

Tyrannicall practizes of Rich. 2 and his aceomplices. See IIolz'nsh.
p. 456, an. reg. 11 : 457, 458, 462, 487. See also the Parl. Holinslz.
490, 493; blanck charters, 496 ; and other tyrannical actions, ibid.
See also the articles against him in Parliament. Holin. 502, also
508. [xix]

Aiding tyrants. The Black Prince, by aiding the cruel tyrant
Peter of Castile, brought himseIFe to all the mischeifs that fell on
his latter days and. his fathers3 for besides the suspicion of poyson
on the voiage‚ he brought himself into so deep debt, bceing
defrauded of his soldiers pay by the ingratfull tyram, that he was
forc'd to raise that sharp taxation of fuage in Aquitain, wherby he
lost the country. See our writers and Spe. p. 597.

thether it be lawfull to rise against a tyrant. Sir Thomas
Smitlz prudently answers that the common people judge of that act
according to the event and successe, and the learned according to
the purpose of the doers, &c. Com-wealth of Engl. c. 5. [xx.]

Ludovicus Pius, beeing made judge of a certain German tyram,
approves the people who had depos’d him and sets his younger
brother up in his stead. Girard, Hist. F rance, l. 4, p. 248. [xxi.]

Scoti proceres missis ad Elizabetham legatis post Mariam regno
pulsam, jure id factum multis exemplis contendunt. T lencm. hist.
l. 50, pag. 769. [xxii.]
