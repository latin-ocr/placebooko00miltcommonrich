The Inquisitors of Venice worthily condemned the boolces of Peter
Aretine, called the Scmcrye of Princes, for the filthynesse of them, and

Qui qiace Z'Aretz'n poeta Tusco,
Chi disse mal d’ oynun’ fuora che di Dio,
Scusandosi, dicendo, io no’ Γ coynosco.

Here lyes Aretine, a poet of T uscany,
Who spake ill of all but God,
Eoecusiny himselfe7 sayiny I know him not.

Noth'thstandiny his vitious sze and writz'nsss hee found one pane-

Eceo ilflayello dei Prineipi‚
I Z divin Pietro Aretino.

Upon the sepulchre of John Boccado, one of the refiners of the
Italian tonyue, at Castel Certaldo in Italy, these verses are written

Mens sedet ante Deum meritis ornata laboris,-

Patria Certaldo, studium fuit alma Poesz's.
