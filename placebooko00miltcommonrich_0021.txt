INTRODUCTION. xvii

contained in the prose composition, are on a single leaf of foolscap
papcr much damaged by damp and its left margin destroyed. In
the left-hand margin on a level with the first line is the name
Milton. When I first discovered the paper, and for some days
afterwards, the letters es were visible immediately preceding the
word Milt0n; but that portion of the paper soon crumbled into
dust. That the marginal words were Jolzamzes Milton may be
safely conceded. The leaf was found loose in the same box
with the Commonplace Book. The ideas expressed in these two
short compositions are not recondite, but they show the same
delight with the beauties of Nature which Milton afterwards ex-
pressed in choicer language. Ι conclude that these are juvenile
efforts of Milton which he did not think worthy of publication
when in 1674 he gave to the world the Prolusiones Orcttoriae. In
support of the opinion that John Milton the poet was the composer
of the contents of this single leaf, the following passages from his
acknowledged writings may be cited.

In the Prolusion Utrum Dies an Noa· proestantz'or sit? are the
following passages:

Et certe primo quam omnium animantium stirpi grata sit et desiderabilis
[Dies]⁷ quid opere est vohis exponere? cum Vel ipsae volucres nequeant
suum celare gaudium, quin egressae nidulis, ubi primuni dilucidavit, aut
in verticibus arborum concentu suavissimo deliniant omnia, aut sursum
librantes se, et quam possunt prope solem volitent, redeunti gratulaturae
luci. Ac primus omnium adventantem Solem triumphat insomnus gallus,
et quasi praeCO quivis, monere videtur homines, ut excusso somno pro-
deant, atque obviam effundant se novam salutatum Auroram: tripudiant
in agris capellae, totumque genus quadrupedum gestit et exultat laetitia
......... Caltha quoque et Rosa ne nihil addant communi gaudio,
aperientes sinum, odores suos Soli tantum servatos profuse spirant, quibus
noctem dedignantur impertiri ......... caeterique flores inclinata
paulum et rore languidula erigentes capita quasi praebcnt sc Soli .......
