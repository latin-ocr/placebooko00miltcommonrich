INTRODUCTwN. xix

could not prevent the Greek e which Milton afterwards, for a long
period, adopted from appearing now and then. Even here appears
, occasionally the disconnection of letters which was afterwards one
of the characteristics of Milton's writing: and in the latter lines of
the verses a likeness to some of Milton’s undoubted writing is
visible. I must, however, express my doubt whether the writing is
by ajuvenile hand.

How or when the Commonplace Book came amongst the Netherby
MSS. is not known. The late Sir James Graham concluded that
it contained some writing by Lord Preston. &Vliether Lord Preston
had any acquaintance with Milton or any of his family is uncertain:
from his letters it is clear that he was a collector of books and of
MSS.a and curious about literary matters. It is said that Milton
gave away or disposed of his library before his death: but it is not
likely that he would have parted with his Commonplace Books;
his daughters however are said to have made free with his books;
50 that this may have been one which they disposed of, and which
Lord Preston secured3 or again he may have procured it directly
or indirectly from Daniel Skinner‚ who after Milton's death carried
off into Holland some of Milton’s books.b This last conjecture seems
probable. It is known that Skinner transcribed portions of the
Treatise De Doctrind Clm'stiami‚ and the first and third entries at
p. 197 of the Commonplace Book (see Autotype) are by Skinner’s
hand. He was with Lord Preston at westminster School, and
when the latter was Envoy at Paris in 1682 Skinner wrote two

³ A copy of. the sale catalogue of Lord Preston's large libi-ary (sold at London in
1696) is at Longleat. Among the books is a copy of Bodin’sTreatise on a Common-
wealth translated into English (fol. Lond. 1606). All the extracts from this trans-
lation are in Lord Preston's writing. The single note by Milton from Bodin, p. 189,
seems to be from a Latin edition.
