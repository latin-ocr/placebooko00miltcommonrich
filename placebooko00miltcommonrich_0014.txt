as all the titles there are found in the MS. as it now exists‚ it
may be concluded that none of the text of the volume has been
removed. The cover was rough brown sheep—skin without any
trace of lettering, and neither the cover nor its contents contained
any name of the original or any later possessor.a

Attention may be drawn to a few of the entries in the volume.
At p. 5 Milton notices (from Beda) Caedmon and his poetry.

used in Law Report-s, as “gibberisl1.’'—At p. 180 his remark
on the tendenoy of the English to follow F rench fashions would
seem to lead to the inference that the sentence was written soon
after the marriage of Charles I. There is evidently an allusion to
Charles Ι. at p. 246, where remonstrants are by the Prince treated
as Rebels.

It will be noticed that the numerous original chroniclers and
writers of English history vouched by Milton in his History of
Britain do not seem to have been read by him while the Common-
place Book was in process of compilation. I have examined the
prose works of Milton with a view to find how sar this Commonplace
Book was made serviceable in his various compositions; for facility
of reference, use has been made of the edition, in one volume, by
Robert Fletcher, 8vo., Lond. 1858, and notes will direct the

Zaehnmlorf, and he has strengthened and admirably treated the leaves without in
