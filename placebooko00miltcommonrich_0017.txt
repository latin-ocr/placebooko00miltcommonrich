similes in the printed edition of the T reatise De Doctrina Christiana,
and in the English translation of it, and in Professor Masson’s Life
of Milton, will enable anyone to compare all the speeimens except
those of the entries by Lord Preston’s hand. The small writing
by Milton is of earlier date than the large.

Milton's writing has some distinguishing marks. He is not
careful, after a full stop, to begin the following sentence with a
capital letter3a lie is indifferent to the correct spelling of names of
persons3 he always writes prcelacie, prcecept, prcetence3b he always
writes thira or thir for the possessive pronoun their.c

‘² In the print this peculiarity is only shown in a few entries.

¹³ Milton was not alone in this practice. It was rather common in the seventeenth
century. Lord Anglesey‚ who was an acquaintance of Milton, spelled in the salne way.

⁰ 1 have seen the MS. poem found by Mr. Morley at the end of Milton's Poems
(8vo. 1645): the use of the form their is alone, Ι think, conclusive against its being
by Milton’s hand; and there are objections 111 the writing‚ particularly the form of
the small Ιι. The bad grammar and the full stnffing of concerti are strong
arguments against it being composed by Milton. The 1150 of the same form their
in the poem signed J. M. written on a blank page of Rosse's Mel Heliconium is, I
think, fatal to the claim of those verses to be by Milton's hand3 and the small e
there most frequently used is not that used by Milton. Iu the initials J. M.
appended to that poem the J. is not crossed, a variation from all the undoubted
signatures of Milton, and the M. (as Mr. Sotheby admits) is at variance with that
used by Milton.

It is remarkable that both poenis introduce the Bee, and the alchemical fiction of
a flower being reprodueible from its calcined ashes.

Among the MSS. of Sir Reginald Graliam, Bart. is a volume of poetry con—
taining an epitaph on Madau] Elizabeth Swettenham in 14 lines, where the
similarity of the 12th and 13th lines to the 3rd and 4th of the disputed poem is
noticeable.

Beqins, If chearfull, chast as are the snows.

Dads, No soul can be more blest than this,

Whose sacred reliques 111 this urn

Are kept until the Soul's return,

To re-unite itself to its known mate,

And raise these reliques to an happier state.

The same volume of poetry contains the following, “ J ulii Mazarini Cardinalis
Epitaphium. authore Joh. Milton.'’ The writer then gives the last three lines of
